                    Tracking a Change of Trends in Spinal Cord Injury in Bangladesh (2011 to 2021): An Epidemiological Findings from an 11-Year Single-Centre Study.

                <span class="bold-header">Responsibilities and Summary:</span> 
                I conducted a ten-year study on 3,575 spinal cord injury (SCI) cases at Bangladesh's 
                largest SCI rehabilitation center (CRP) to identify trends and causes of disability following SCI. 
                Analyzing patient records and conducting follow-up interviews, I found that 93% 
                of injuries were traumatic, primarily from falling from height and road accidents. 
                <br>
                When analyzed for non-traumatic causes, spinal tuberculosis (TB), Pott’s disease 
                and myelopathy was the most common cause. Pressure sore was found to be the 
                leading cause of mortality. 
                <br>
                In addition, I summarized the record data into spacial modeling to reveal the density 
                of SCI across different divisions of Bangladesh. I found that Dhaka which is the capital 
                city of Bangladesh has the most cases of SCI. The results also reveal that women are more 
                exposed to Pott’s disease compared to male SCI patients. The article is in Medrexiv repository.

               CRP has developed a low-cost, open-source manual standing wheelchair with the aim of providing an affordable alternative to expensive medical equipment. 
              When I was doing my internship, I got engaged in this study where we had recruited thirty participants to evaluate the wheelchair’s usability and safety through questionnaires and hands-on testing. 
                
                <br>

                I was responsible for statistical testing and visualizing the data. The results showed high user satisfaction, 
              with participants reporting increased confidence, ease of use, and a greater ability to participate in household activities.

                    Present Status of Physical Impairments of Children with Cerebral Palsy at Ambience of Inclusive Education: A Cross-Sectional Study from Bangladesh

                <span class="bold-header">Responsibilities and Summary:</span> 
               I conducted the statistical analysis of a cross-sectional study on 201 children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) in inclusive schools to evaluate how physical impairments affect their functional independence. 
              The research project aimed to improve academic participation and life outcomes for children with CP in low-resource environments. 
              By using standardized assessment tools like the GMFM-88 and WeeFIM, I analyzed the motor function and manual dexterity of students aged 6–14. 
              The results revealed that over half of the children with spastic CP suffered from severe balance deficits, and both age & CP subtypes significantly impacted their ability to perform daily tasks.

                <span class="bold-header">Responsibilities and Summary:</span> 
               As the lead statistician, I managed the data extraction and synthesis for a systematic review investigating the effectiveness of various physiotherapy interventions on upper limb motor recovery for stroke survivors. I led a group of 10 data extractors and analyzed over 8,000 potential studies from major medical databases (2012–2022). 
              By rigorous screening process the final inclusion was 91 high-quality randomized clinical trial articles. 
             <br>
                 In collaboration with a data analytics expert, I applied statistical frameworks to evaluate the outcomes of exercise therapy, robotics, and virtual reality across diverse patient groups. 
              The analysis is ongoing and PROSPERO registration for the study is on-going.
