                I conducted a ten-year study of 3,575 spinal cord injury (SCI) cases at Bangladesh's 
                largest SCI rehabilitation center to identify trends and causes of disability. 
                Analyzing patient records and conducting follow-up interviews, I found that 93% 
                of injuries were traumatic, primarily from falling from height and road accidents. 
                
                <br><br> When analyzed for non-traumatic causes, spinal tuberculosis (TB), Pott’s disease 
                and myelopathy was the most prevalent causes. Pressure sore was found to be the 
                leading cause of mortality. In addition, I summarized the record data into special 
                modeling to reveal the density of SCI in different divisions of Bangladesh. 
                
                <br><br> I found that Dhaka which is the capital city of Bangladesh has the most cases of 
                SCI. I also found that women are more exposed to Pott’s disease when compared 
                with male SCI patients.
