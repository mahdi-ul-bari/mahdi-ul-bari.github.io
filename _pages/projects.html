                <span class="bold-header">Responsibilities and Summary:</span> 
                I conducted a ten-year study of 3,575 spinal cord injury (SCI) cases at Bangladesh's 
                largest SCI rehabilitation center to identify trends and causes of disability. 
                Analyzing patient records and conducting follow-up interviews, I found that 93% 
                of injuries were traumatic, primarily from falling from height and road accidents. 
                
                <br><br>

                When analyzed for non-traumatic causes, spinal tuberculosis (TB), Pott’s disease 
                and myelopathy was the most prevalent causes. Pressure sore was found to be the 
                leading cause of mortality. 
                
                <br><br>

                In addition, I summarized the record data into special modeling to reveal the density 
                of SCI in different divisions of Bangladesh. I found that Dhaka which is the capital 
                city of Bangladesh has the most cases of SCI. I also found that women are more 
                exposed to Pott’s disease when compared with male SCI patients.
