                <span class="bold-header">Responsibilities and Summary:</span> 
                I conducted a ten-year study of 3,575 spinal cord injury (SCI) cases at Bangladesh's 
                largest SCI rehabilitation center to identify trends and causes of disability. 
                Analyzing patient records and conducting follow-up interviews, I found that 93% 
                of injuries were traumatic, primarily from falling from height and road accidents. 
                <br>
                When analyzed for non-traumatic causes, spinal tuberculosis (TB), Pott’s disease 
                and myelopathy was the most prevalent causes. Pressure sore was found to be the 
                leading cause of mortality. 
                <br>
                In addition, I summarized the record data into special modeling to reveal the density 
                of SCI in different divisions of Bangladesh. I found that Dhaka which is the capital 
                city of Bangladesh has the most cases of SCI. I also found that women are more 
                exposed to Pott’s disease when compared with male SCI patients. The article is in Medrexiv repository.

               CRP has developed a low-cost, open-source manual standing wheelchair with the aim of providing an affordable alternative to expensive medical equipment. 
              When I was doing my internship, I got engaged in this study where we had recruited thirty participants to evaluate the wheelchair’s usability and safety through questionnaires and hands-on testing. 
                
                <br>

                I was responsible for statistical testing and visualizing the meaning of the data. The results showed high user satisfaction, 
              with participants reporting increased confidence, ease of use, and a greater ability to participate in household activities.
